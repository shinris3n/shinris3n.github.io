Author: @JohnHammond#6971

Nina found some new encryption scheme that she apparently thinks is really cool. She's annoying but she found a flag or something, can you deal with her?

Connect with:

nc challenge.ctf.games 31921
``` 
<h3><font color=FF3030> Solution: </font></h3>

- Connecting to the service, we are provided with the encrypted flag and allowed to encrypt any string we like.  For this competition, we know that the flag is 32 characters in the format "flag{0-9a-f}", so we can check out what "flag{" maps to:

```console

NINA: But I encrypted it with a very special nonce, the same length as 
      the flag! I heard people say this encryption method is unbreakable!
      I'll even let you encrypt something to prove it!! What should we encrypt?

NINA: Ta-daaa!! I think this is called a 'one' 'time' 'pad' or something?

- The output does indeed seem to indicate that a one time pad is being used... except it is the same pad being used for every string we enter.  It also appears that each character we enter is mapped to a hexadecimal value.  We can assume these things because we input a five character string and saw that the first 10 characters of the encrypted string we received back were the same as the first 10 characters of the flag we were provided when we connected to the service.  

- If we disconnect from the service and re-connect, however, the pad appears to change:

- One approach is to brute force this challenge by staying connected and interacting with the service, cycling through the possible flag values and matching hexidecimal values until we determine what the flag is.  

- The brute force method is easy enough to use to solve this, but as it turns out this really is just a standard one-time pad implementation (with no twists).  We should therefore be able to get the key by simply passing along any value equal to the key length (which we were told was the same length as the flag when we first connected to the service).  Next, we can just XOR the plaintext we chose with the encrypted response we received to get the key.  Finally, we XOR the encrypted flag with the key and receive the plaintext flag!  Trying this out:

```python
# H@cktivityCon 2021 - N1TP Solution (Finding the Key with Chosen Plaintext)
# shinris3n

import socket

address = 'challenge.ctf.games'
port = 30966
buffer = 4096

# The encrypted flag received from "NINA" after connecting to the service.
encrypted_flag = ''

# Send over plaintext of equal length to the key (which equals the flag length)
input_to_encrypt = 'flag{0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef}'

received_data = ''

# Open up connection.
tcpsocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
tcpsocket.connect((address, port))

# Get greeting.
received_data = tcpsocket.recv(buffer).decode('utf-8')
print (received_data)

# Retrieve and store the encrypted flag. 
received_data = tcpsocket.recv(buffer).decode('utf-8')
encrypted_flag = received_data[6:82] # The flag appears to be hex formatted, 64 characters plus 12 characters for the flag{} portion, and 6 spaces of padding.
print ('Encrypted Flag:', encrypted_flag)

# Send input to encrypt in flag format.
formatted_data_to_send = (input_to_encrypt + '\n').encode('utf-8')
tcpsocket.send(formatted_data_to_send)
print ('Data sent:', input_to_encrypt)

# Get and store encrypted response.
received_data = tcpsocket.recv(buffer).decode('utf-8') # Get flavor text
print (received_data)
received_data = tcpsocket.recv(buffer).decode('utf-8') # Get encrypted response
encrypted_response = received_data[6:82] # Same format as the original flag.
print (received_data)
print ('Encrypted Flag:', encrypted_flag)
print ('Encrypted Response:', encrypted_response)

# Figure out the key by XORing the plaintext input that was sent with the encrypted value received

plaintext_hex = input_to_encrypt.encode("utf-8").hex()
plaintext_hex_value = int(plaintext_hex, 16)

encrypted_plaintext_hex = int((encrypted_response), 16)
otp_key_value = plaintext_hex_value^encrypted_plaintext_hex

print ("Key: ", hex(otp_key_value))

# Find the flag by XORing the encrypted flag and the key

encrypted_flag_value = int((encrypted_flag), 16)
plaintext_flag_hex = hex(encrypted_flag_value^otp_key_value)

plaintext_flag = bytes.fromhex(plaintext_flag_hex[2:])

print ("Flag calculated as:",  str(plaintext_flag)[2:-1])
```

- Running this quickly returns the flag.
