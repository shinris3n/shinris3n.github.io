### In a divide and conquer strategy to check out both the [RTV CTF](https://redteamvillage.io/ctf){:target="_blank"}  and the [CyberWraith](https://redteamvillage.io/cyberwraith.html){:target="_blank"}  Tournament, some team members conquered a bit more than others this year:

### *shinris3n* also makes an appearance somewhere on the list, right below some RN that decided she could be pretty good at this stuff and proved it...

### Team NINPWN also took 100th place in the [RTV CTF quals](https://ctf.threatsims.com/teams/143){:target="_blank"}. This was thanks to the help of a new member to the team: *bongo42*.  We were psyched that *bongo* could join us, and we hope he joins us for many more competitions moving forward!
